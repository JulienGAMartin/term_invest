@article{Grafen2006,
abstract = {The first fully explicit argument is given that broadly supports a widespread belief among whole-organism biologists that natural selection tends to lead to organisms acting as if maximizing their inclusive fitness. The use of optimization programs permits a clear statement of what this belief should be understood to mean, in contradistinction to the common mathematical presumption that it should be formalized as some kind of Lyapunov or even potential function. The argument reveals new details and uncovers latent assumptions. A very general genetic architecture is allowed, and there is arbitrary uncertainty. However, frequency dependence of fitnesses is not permitted. The logic of inclusive fitness immediately draws together various kinds of intra-genomic conflict, and the concept of 'p-family' is introduced. Inclusive fitness is thus incorporated into the formal Darwinism project, which aims to link the mathematics of motion (difference and differential equations) used to describe gene frequency trajectories with the mathematics of optimization used to describe purpose and design. Important questions remain to be answered in the fundamental theory of inclusive fitness.},

	title = {Natural selection and the evolution of reproductive effort},
	volume = {72},
	abstract = {Reproductive effort is defined as that proportion of the total energy budget of an organism that is devoted to reproductive processes. Reproductive effort at a given age within a species will be selected to maximize reproductive value at that age. Reproductive effort is not directly affected by changes in juvenile survivorship, nor necessarily reduced by an increase in adult survivorship. Selection for high levels of reproductive effort should occur when extrinsic adult mortality is high, in environments with constant juvenile survivorship, and in good years for juvenile survivorship in a variable environment, provided that the quality of the year is predictable by adults. Data necessary to measure reproductive effort and to understand how selection results in different levels of effort between individuals and species are discussed. We make several predictions about the effect of increased resource availability on reproductive effort. The empirical bases for testing these predictions are presently inadequate, and we consider data on energy budgets of organisms in nature to be essential for such test. We also conclude that variance in life table parameters must be known in detail to understand the selective bases of levels of reproductive effort},
